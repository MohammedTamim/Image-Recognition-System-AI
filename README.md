# Image Recognition 5-Day Bootcamp

This repository contains the materials and code developed during an intensive 5-day bootcamp on Image Recognition. The bootcamp covers fundamental concepts of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), progressing to advanced topics like transfer learning and model deployment.

## Course Outline:

*   **Day 01: Introduction to Image Recognition and Deep Learning**
    *   What is Image Recognition? What is Deep Learning?
    *   Understanding Datasets and Preprocessing
    *   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    *   *Code Example:* Loading and preprocessing MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

*   **Day 02: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
    *   Fundamentals of CNNs
    *   Model Training Workflow
    *   The Role of Dropout in Regularization
    *   Model Evaluation Techniques
    *   *Code Example:* Building and training a basic CNN for MNIST classification.

*   **Day 03: Deeper CNNs, Data Augmentation, and Advanced Evaluation**
    *   Why Deeper CNN Architectures?
    *   Data Augmentation for Improved Robustness
    *   Advanced Evaluation Metrics (e.g., Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
    *   *Code Example:* Implementing data augmentation and evaluating a deeper CNN on CIFAR-10.

*   **Day 04: Pre-trained Models and Transfer Learning**
    *   Introduction to Pre-trained Models (MobileNetV2, ResNet, VGG, ImageNet)
    *   Concepts of Transfer Learning
    *   Fine-Tuning and Optimization Strategies
    *   Model Deployment Considerations
    *   *Code Example:* Utilizing MobileNetV2 for transfer learning on a "Cats vs. Dogs" dataset.

*   **Day 05: Prediction on New Data and Portfolio Presentation**
    *   Making Predictions on Unseen Data
    *   Creating Portfolio Assets
    *   Effective Presentation of Results
    *   *Code Example:* Demonstrating prediction on a new image and visualizing model accuracies across different datasets.

## How to Use This Repository:

Each day's content is structured to provide both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. You can follow along with the provided Jupyter notebooks (or similar script files) to replicate the experiments and deepen your understanding.

## Getting Started:

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-recognition-bootcamp.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd image-recognition-bootcamp
    ```
3.  **Install the required libraries** (it's recommended to use a virtual environment):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is not explicitly provided in the context, but would be a standard addition for a GitHub repo. You would create this file by listing all dependencies.)*

4.  **Explore the notebooks** for each day to understand the concepts and run the code examples.
